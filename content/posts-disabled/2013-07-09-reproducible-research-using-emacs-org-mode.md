title: Reproducible research using Emacs org-mode
tags: emacs, org-mode

Via the [Irreal](http://irreal.org/blog/?p=1992) blog I learned of
professor John Kitchin's excellent usage of Emacs, org-mode and Python
to create reproducible research and books.

A good definition of reproducible research is:

> "I have in the last couple of years fallen in love with org-mode and
> in particular with 'reproducible research', or living documents; the
> ability to have executable sections of code for generating results,
> which can then themselves be further analyzed by other bits of code &#x2014;
> in other languages, if thatâ€™s appropriate &#x2013; and the whole exported as
> a document typeset to what I consider to be high-quality standards.
> The fact that there is also acceptable-quality web output from the
> exact same process is gravy."

Here are links to professor Kitchin's material on using Emacs +
org-mode + Python for reproducible research:

-   [Python Computations in Science and Engineering](http://jkitchin.github.io/pycse/) : Complete book done using "reproducible research"
    
    -   [source](https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse) for the book (everything - and reproducible - that's the point)

I'll be studying his books' source.
