[Slides](https://github.com/haroldcarr/presentations/blob/master/2017-05-27-lambdaconf-recursion-schemes.pdf) for my May 27, 2017 [LambdaConf](http://lambdaconf.us/) talk on recursion schemes.

This presentation is unique in that shows "list only" versions of a number of recursions schemes.
This makes it easier to understand for beginners (because it avoids the need to talk about `Fix`).
