I have written a series of articles to teach myself monads.  You might find them useful.

-   [concrete monads 0 : motivating example](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/haroldcarr/example-of-why-to-use-monads-what-they-can-do)

-   [concrete monads 1 : `Maybe`, `Either`, list, `IO`](http://haroldcarr.com/posts/2013-12-15-concrete-monads-1-maybe-either-list-io.html)

-   concrete monads 2 : Writer, Reader, State (TBD)
