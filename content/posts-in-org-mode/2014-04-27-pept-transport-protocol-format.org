Erik Meijer [[https://twitter.com/headinthebox/statuses/460414363166576640][points out]] a typo (or conceptual error) in [[https://t.co/77tsmmMADr][an FPComplete article]] that calls JSON a protocol and HTTP a format.

The [[http://bit.ly/1tRj5TY][PEPT]] remoting architecture considers:

- a transport to be something that moves bits from one location to another
  - a transport is something where the program does /not/ manipulate header bits
  - e.g., most apps do not touch TCP/IP header bits, they just write/read from the TCP/IP streams
- a remoting protocol is something where, besides moving bits, the program /will/ manipulate the header bits
  - e.g., HTTP is a protocol for REST
  - e.g., HTTP is a transport for SOAP (in general)
- a remoting format is
  - a serial encoding of the application data
  - a serial encoding of protocol and/or transport headers
  - e.g., JSON is a common application format for REST
  - e.g., XML is both the application format and the protocol format for SOAP
  - e.g., [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Data_Representation][CDR]] is both the application format and the protocol format for CORBA IIOP

There are, of course, special cases, but the above taxonomy provides a useful separation of concerns.
