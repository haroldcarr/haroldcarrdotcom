Via the [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=1992][Irreal]] blog I learned of
professor John Kitchin's excellent usage of Emacs, org-mode and Python
to create reproducible research and books.

A good definition of reproducible research is:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"I have in the last couple of years fallen in love with org-mode and
in particular with 'reproducible research', or living documents; the
ability to have executable sections of code for generating results,
which can then themselves be further analyzed by other bits of code ---
in other languages, if thatâ€™s appropriate -- and the whole exported as
a document typeset to what I consider to be high-quality standards.
The fact that there is also acceptable-quality web output from the
exact same process is gravy."

Here are links to professor Kitchin's material on using Emacs +
org-mode + Python for reproducible research:

  - [[https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse][source]] for the book (everything - and reproducible - that's the point)

I'll be studying his books' source.
